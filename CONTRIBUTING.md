## Guidelines Before Starting to Code

Please follow these guidelines before starting to code your feature or bugfix.

### Implementing Bugfix or Feature Request from an Existing Issue

- If you want to implement a bugfix or feature request from an existing issue, please comment on that issue that you will work on it. This helps us coordinate what needs to be done and what not.

### Implementing a Feature Request Without an Existing Issue

- If you want to implement a feature request without an existing issue, please create an issue so we know what you are working on and discuss the feature.

### Major Feature Implementations

- For major feature implementations, make sure you are able to maintain your code in the future in regard to bugs and possible code conflicts in future updates.

## Join the community

- Optionally, you could join the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/RwEByybh42), so you will hear instantly if something needs to be worked on.

## Guidelines Before Sending Your Pull Request and Making Contributions

Please follow these guidelines before sending your pull request and making contributions.

### Pull Request Agreement

- When you submit a pull request, you agree that your code is published under the [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v2.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).

### Linking Issues

- Link the issue you are referring to.

### Code Inclusions

- Do not include non-free software or modules with your code.

### Pull Request Setup

- Make sure your pull request is set up to merge your branch to Anthias MSU-Denver Board development branch.

- Make sure your branch is up to date with the development branch before submitting your pull request.

### Coding Style

- Stick to a similar style of code already in the project. Please look at the current code to get an idea of how to do this.

- Comment your code when necessary. Follow the CSS and PYTHON Documentation and Comments Standard for functions.

### Testing

- Please test your code. Make sure new features work as well as existing core features such as watching videos or loading subscriptions.

### Code Standards

- Please make sure your code does not violate any standards set by our linter. It's up to you to make fixes whenever necessary.

### Dependency Management

- Please limit the amount of Node Modules that you introduce into the project.

### Community Engagement

- Please try to stay involved with the community and maintain your code.

- We are only a handful of developers working on the Board in our spare time. We do not have time to work on everything, and it would be nice if you can maintain your code when necessary.
